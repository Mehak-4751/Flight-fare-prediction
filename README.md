## Methodology

For this project, we have implemented the machine learning
life cycle to create a basic web application which will predict
the flight prices by applying machine learning algorithm to
historical flight data using python libraries like Pandas, NumPy,
Matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn

## Novelty of project

1.The front-end of the application will be created using the
bootstrap framework where user will have the functionality of
entering their flight data. This data will be sent to the back-end
service where the model will predict the output according to
the provided data. The predicted value is sent to the front-end
and displayed.

2.  There are also different cross-validation techniques such as
gridsearchCV and randomizedsearchCV which will be used for
improving the accuracy of the model. Parameters of the
models such as number of trees in random forest or max depth
of decision tree can be changed using this technique which will
help us in further enhancement of the accuracy.
